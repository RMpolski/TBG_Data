Changelog for QCoDeS 0.13.0
===========================

The April 2020 release of QCoDeS

Breaking Changes:
_________________

* The dictionary ``station.components['config']`` representing a Station
  configuration loaded from a YAML file has been moved to ``station.config``.
  The same change is reflected in the snapshot and the config can now
  be accessed via ``station_snapshot['config']``. (#1913)

* The ``QCoDeS`` configuration module has moved from ``qcodes.config`` to ``qcodes.configuration``
  to disambiguate it from the current active config which is defined in ``qcodes.config`` as always (#1682)

* It is now an error to overwrite get and set in a ``_BaseParameter`` subclass. Users have been warned against this
  for a long time (#1946)

* The legacy api such as Loop, active_loop, active_data_set, Measure, DataSet, new_data, load_data, Task, Wait, BreakIf,
  FormatLocation, DataArray, Formatter, GNUPlotFormat, HDF5Format, DiskIO, are no more imported in ``QCoDeS`` namespace
  by default. The core config now contains a new flag `import_legacy_api` that can be set to True if the legacy api
  needs to be imported in the ``QCoDeS`` namespace. (#1962)

* The Deprecated ``log_analysis`` module has been retired (#1950)

Improved drivers:
_________________

* ``get_last_run`` has been improved to match the signature of ``get_runs`` (#1960)
