New drivers:
____________


Improved drivers:
_________________
* The Keithley 2450 driver got a bunch of new parameters and methods (#1970, #2052)
* The Keysight B1500 driver now checks errors after setting each parameter (#2041) and outputs `NaN` instead of `199.999e99` when compliance is reached (#2074)
* The Keysight B1520A driver saw a bunch of improvements:
   * sweep API was restructured more logically (#2044)
   * the driver now supports all possible impedance models (#2047)
   * the measurement status is retrieved after each sweep (#2050)
   * added `get_cmds` for `sweep_auto_abort` and `post_sweep_auto_abort` (#2049)
* The Keysight B1517A driver had the following improvements:
   * the measurement status is retrieved after each sweep (#2050).
   * added `get_cmds` for `sweep_auto_abort` and `post_sweep_auto_abort` (#2049)
   * added measurement status to current/voltage parameters (#2051)

Improved:
_________
* All master-slave references from drivers have been removed or deprecated (#2066)
* QCoDeS now comes with a code of conduct (#2078)

Under the hood:
_______________

* Better execution of the test suite and hardening of tests (#2016, #2037, #2038, #2039, #2040, #2042, #2045, #2056, #2057, #2063, #2064, #2070, #2073, #2077, #2076). Special highlights from this massive work:
   * The test suite now runs in parallel, a major win for all developers
   * Much better handling of the QCoDeS config system as a result
* Update of dependencies to `mypy` 0.782 (#2034, #2075) and `pyqtgraph` 0.11.0 (#2036)
* The `measurements.py` module is now slightly better type-annotated (#2065)
* Documentation is built with Spinx 3.1.2 (#2069, #2072)
* Added support for (upcoming) `pytest` 6 and explicit dependency on `packaging` (#2076)
